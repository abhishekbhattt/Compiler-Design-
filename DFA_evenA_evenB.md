## Lexical Analyzer Description

This document provides an overview and explanation of a lexical analyzer implemented using Flex (Fast Lexical Analyzer Generator). The lexical analyzer is designed to recognize patterns in a given input and categorize them into specific tokens.

### Introduction

The provided code is a Flex program that serves as a lexical analyzer. It processes input text and identifies patterns according to the defined rules. The program then generates tokens based on these patterns, allowing for further processing or analysis of the input.

### Lexical Analyzer Implementation

#### Flex Specifications

The Flex specifications define the rules for recognizing patterns and generating tokens. These specifications are written in the `%{ ... %}` section and the `%%` block. Here's a brief overview of the key components:

- **Lexical States**: The lexer can be in one of several states (`INITIAL`, `A`, `B`), each with its own set of rules for pattern recognition.
- **Regular Expressions**: Patterns are defined using regular expressions, such as `[a-z]` to match any lowercase letter.
- **Actions**: Actions associated with pattern matches are defined using C code enclosed in curly braces `{ ... }`.

#### Main Function

The `main` function initializes the lexer and starts processing input. It calls the `yylex` function, which scans the input text and generates tokens based on the defined rules.

### Understanding the Code

#### Lexical States

- **`INITIAL` State**: This is the initial state of the lexer. It processes characters according to the rules defined in the `BEGIN INITIAL;` block.
- **`A` State**: This state is entered when certain conditions are met, such as encountering the character 'a'. Rules specific to this state are defined in the `BEGIN A;` block.
- **`B` State**: Similar to the `A` state, this state is entered under specific conditions. Rules for this state are defined in the `BEGIN B;` block.

#### Token Recognition

- **Pattern Matching**: Patterns are matched using regular expressions. For example, `[a]` matches the character 'a'.
- **Actions**: Actions associated with pattern matches perform tasks such as changing states (`BEGIN ...`) or printing messages (`printf()`).

#### Main Control Flow

The main control flow of the program involves repeatedly calling `yylex()` to scan the input text. Depending on the current state and input characters, the lexer transitions between different states and performs actions accordingly.

### Conclusion

This lexical analyzer implemented using Flex provides a framework for recognizing patterns and generating tokens from input text. By defining rules and actions, it can effectively process input according to specified criteria.


```lex
%{
%}

%s A B

%%
<INITIAL>a BEGIN INITIAL;
<INITIAL>b BEGIN A;
<INITIAL>[^b|\n] BEGIN B;
<INITIAL>\n BEGIN INITIAL; printf("Accepted\n");
<A>a BEGIN A;
<A>b BEGIN INITIAL;
<A>[^b|\n] BEGIN B;
<A>\n BEGIN INITIAL; printf("Not Accepted\n");
<B>a BEGIN B;
<B>b BEGIN B;
<B>[^b|\n] BEGIN B;
<B>\n {BEGIN INITIAL; printf("INVALID\n");}
%%

int yywrap()
{
return 1;
}
void main()
{
yylex();
}

```
